#create a program that simulates a simple ATM machine. It should ask the user for their PIN, verify it, and then allow them to withdraw money if balance is sufficient.

class ATM:
    def __init__(self, pin, balance):
        self.pin = pin
        self.balance = balance 

    def verify_pin(self, entered_pin):
        return self.pin == entererd pin 

    def withdraw_money(self, amount):
        if amount > self.balance:
            print("Insufficient fund.")
        else:
            self.balance = amount
            print("Withdrwal successful. Resuming balance:",self.balance)

def main():
    pin = input("Enter your PIN: ")
    atm = ATM("1234, 1000)

    if atm.verify_pin(pin):
        amount = float(input("Enter the amount to withdraw: "))
        atm.withdraw_money(amount)
    else:
        print("Invalid PIN. Access denied.")
